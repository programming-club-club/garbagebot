node bot.js
requires some dependencies but shouldn't be necessary? i guess

Planned functions: 
!bruh (posts a bruh sound effect idk)
!yt 'whatever' (searches for a youtube video)
!google 'blah blah' (posts a google link to a search for the input maybe)
!uwuize 'sentence' (you know what the fuck this thing does)
!hydration (toggle command maybe? reminder to drink water or some gay shit)
